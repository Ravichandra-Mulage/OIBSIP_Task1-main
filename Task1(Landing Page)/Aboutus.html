                    WHAT IS A FORT?
Forts are a familiar category of monuments, the world over. They also constitute some of the most ancient historical structures apart from places of worship. Etymologically, the word “fort” is derived from the Latin root fortis or forte which means strong or firm.FEATURES
The basic nature of forts as military structures warrants distinct architectural features. An understanding of these unique architectural features/technical terms associated with forts is very important for a clear comprehension of this particular category of monuments.TYPES OF FORTS
Over the centuries, forts were made over diverse physical terrains, by different ruling dynasties and for different purposes. While some forts were purely military outposts, some also had palaces and residential quarters within, while others were primarily trading outposts.
